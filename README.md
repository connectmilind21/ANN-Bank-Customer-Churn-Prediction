## Course: Introduction to Neural Networks 🧠

### Project Overview 📋:
In this project, a neural network model is built to predict customer churn for a banking service. The goal is to help the operations team identify customers more likely to churn and provide retention strategies. 🏦🚀

The project involves building a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras to identify patterns in customer data that lead to churn. Additionally, recommendations on customer retention are provided based on the model's output. 🔍💡

### Skills & Tools Covered 🛠️:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔍: Understanding the data, visualizing distributions, and identifying patterns in the dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing** 🔧: Handling missing values, normalizing features, and encoding categorical variables.
- **TensorFlow & Keras** 🧑‍💻: Building and training a neural network model using deep learning frameworks.
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** 🤖: Implementing a basic neural network to classify customers based on their likelihood to churn.
- **Regularization** 🔒: Applying techniques like dropout and L2 regularization to avoid overfitting and enhance model generalization.

### Project Details 📑:
1. **Data Analysis** 📊:
   - Load and clean the dataset.
   - Perform data exploration to uncover insights about the customer base.
   - Visualize the features and target variable (churn vs. non-churn).

2. **Data Preprocessing** ⚙️:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical features (e.g., gender, product usage) using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
   - Normalize numerical features to bring all inputs to a similar scale.

3. **Model Building** 🏗️:
   - Define a neural network architecture with layers and activation functions.
   - Train the model using the training data.
   - Validate the model using cross-validation and evaluate it on a separate test set.

4. **Model Optimization** ⚡:
   - Implement regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization to improve model performance.
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of layers, number of units).

5. **Retention Recommendations** 💡:
   - Based on the churn prediction, provide business-relevant recommendations to retain high-risk customers (e.g., personalized offers, customer support interventions).
